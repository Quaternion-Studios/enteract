# Audio Capture Fix Test

## Problem Fixed
The original implementation was using `Direction::Render` for render devices, which is incorrect for loopback capture. The working sandbox implementation always uses `Direction::Capture` even for render devices when doing loopback capture.

## Key Fix Applied
```rust
// Before (incorrect):
let (direction, use_loopback) = match device_info.device_type {
    DeviceType::Render => (Direction::Render, true),  // ❌ Wrong
    DeviceType::Capture => (Direction::Capture, false),
};

// After (correct - matches sandbox):
let (direction, use_loopback) = match device_info.device_type {
    DeviceType::Render => (Direction::Capture, true),  // ✅ Fixed
    DeviceType::Capture => (Direction::Capture, false),
};
```

## Expected Result
With this fix, the application should now:
1. ✅ Successfully initialize audio client with YouTube playing
2. ✅ Capture actual audio from YouTube instead of blank audio
3. ✅ Process real transcriptions instead of `[BLANK_AUDIO]`

## Test Instructions
1. Start YouTube video
2. Run the application
3. Check for audio capture success instead of "device may be locked" errors
4. Verify Whisper receives actual audio data instead of blank/silent audio

The fix aligns the current implementation with the proven working sandbox code.
