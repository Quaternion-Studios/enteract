// src-tauri/src/audio_loopback.rs
// This file has been refactored into modules for better organization.
// All functionality is now split across multiple files in the audio_loopback/ directory.
//
// Key improvements made:
// 1. Reduced excessive debug logging that was causing spam
// 2. Enhanced transcription quality filtering to prevent "(crying)" artifacts
// 3. Split large file into manageable modules
// 4. Maintained all sophisticated features from the sandbox implementation
